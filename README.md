# Heston & Longstaff–Schwartz Monte Carlo Dashboard

*Author:* Charvik Reddy Mukku  
*Duration:* 8 months (with pauses, learning, and refining)

## Introduction

This project implements a full Monte Carlo simulation workflow for portfolio pricing, risk metrics, Heston stochastic volatility, and American option pricing using the Longstaff–Schwartz method, topped off with an interactive Plotly dashboard.

It’s the culmination of 8 months of exploration, trial-and-error, and learning finance + programming concepts. During this journey, I did the following.
- Studied books and online resources on finance and stochastic models.
- Watched numerous YouTube tutorials to understand practical implementations.
- Discussed concepts with friends and family knowledgeable in finance.
## Acknowledgements

I heartily thanks my uncle and my friend Rishi for their extremely co-operative help on this otherwise nightmare of a project. Your support on helping me understand and implement the concepts used for this project is beyond words. The nights we spent together understanding and some mornings debugging was epic. Thank you so so much for your time.
## Primary Features

1. *Portfolio Simulation & Risk Metrics* — VaR, CVaR, PnL distributions.
2. *Heston Stochastic Volatility Model* — Monte Carlo simulations.
3. *American Option Pricing* — Longstaff–Schwartz method for optimal exercise.
4. *Interactive Dashboard* — Visualize simulations and results with Plotly.
5. *Unit Tests* — Ensure modules run correctly and produce expected outputs.
## Try it yourself!
